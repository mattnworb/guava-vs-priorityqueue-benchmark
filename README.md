Benchmarks of selecting top-k elements from a list of integers comparing
[Guava's Ordering class][guava] vs the [JDK PriorityQueue implementation][jdk-pq].

This benchmark was inspired by [Selecting top k items from a list efficiently in Java/Groovy][inspiration] 
which benchmarked several algorithms/implementations without being clear on the benchmark strategy used.

These benchmarks use [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/).
